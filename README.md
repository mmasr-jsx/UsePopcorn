### About the project

Another project to learn react, this time is an app where we can fetch movies from "OMDn" (external api), register them on our own watched list, give them a rating etc...

In this project we get used to use custom hooks, we fetch the movies in one of them for example, we learn too about "AbortController" for the search bar and keep reinforcing
our foundations.

### IN CASE ISN'T FETCHING

The key for OMDb is temporal, you will need to generate a new one if you want to play a bit with the project
